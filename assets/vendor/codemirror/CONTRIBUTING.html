<h2 id="Getting-help"><a href="#Getting-help" class="headerlink" title="Getting help"></a>Getting help</h2><p>Community discussion, questions, and informal bug reporting is done on the<br><a href="http://discuss.codemirror.net">discuss.CodeMirror forum</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Submitting-bug-reports"><a href="#Submitting-bug-reports" class="headerlink" title="Submitting bug reports"></a>Submitting bug reports</h2><p>The preferred way to report bugs is to use the<br><a href="http://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/issues">GitHub issue tracker</a>. Before<br>reporting a bug, read these pointers.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The issue tracker is for <em>bugs</em>, not requests for help. Questions<br>should be asked on the<br><a href="http://discuss.codemirror.net">discuss.CodeMirror forum</a> instead.</p>
<h3 id="Reporting-bugs-effectively"><a href="#Reporting-bugs-effectively" class="headerlink" title="Reporting bugs effectively"></a>Reporting bugs effectively</h3><ul>
<li><p>CodeMirror is maintained by volunteers. They don’t owe you anything, so be<br>polite. Reports with an indignant or belligerent tone tend to be moved to the<br>bottom of the pile.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Include information about <strong>the browser in which the problem occurred</strong>. Even<br>if you tested several browsers, and the problem occurred in all of them,<br>mention this fact in the bug report. Also include browser version numbers and<br>the operating system that you’re on.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mention which release of CodeMirror you’re using. Preferably, try also with<br>the current development snapshot, to ensure the problem has not already been<br>fixed.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Mention very precisely what went wrong. “X is broken” is not a good bug<br>report. What did you expect to happen? What happened instead? Describe the<br>exact steps a maintainer has to take to make the problem occur. We can not<br>fix something that we can not observe.</p>
</li>
<li><p>If the problem can not be reproduced in any of the demos included in the<br>CodeMirror distribution, please provide an HTML document that demonstrates<br>the problem. The best way to do this is to go to<br><a href="http://jsbin.com/ihunin/edit">jsbin.com</a>, enter it there, press save, and<br>include the resulting link in your bug report.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Contributing-code"><a href="#Contributing-code" class="headerlink" title="Contributing code"></a>Contributing code</h2><p>Note that we are not accepting any new addons or modes into the main<br>distribution. If you’ve written such a module, please distribute it as<br>a separate NPM package.</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure you have a <a href="https://github.com/signup/free">GitHub Account</a></li>
<li>Fork <a href="https://github.com/codemirror/CodeMirror/">CodeMirror</a><br>(<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">how to fork a repo</a>)</li>
<li>Make your changes</li>
<li>If your changes are easy to test or likely to regress, add tests.<br>Tests for the core go into <code>test/test.js</code>, some modes have their own<br>test suite under <code>mode/XXX/test.js</code>. Feel free to add new test<br>suites to modes that don’t have one yet (be sure to link the new<br>tests into <code>test/index.html</code>).</li>
<li>Follow the general code style of the rest of the project (see<br>below). Run <code>bin/lint</code> to verify that the linter is happy.</li>
<li>Make sure all tests pass. Visit <code>test/index.html</code> in your browser to<br>run them.</li>
<li>Submit a pull request<br>(<a href="https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo">how to create a pull request</a>).<br>Don’t put more than one feature/fix in a single pull request.</li>

<p>By contributing code to CodeMirror you</p>
<ul>
<li><p>agree to license the contributed code under CodeMirror’s <a href="http://codemirror.net/LICENSE">MIT<br>license</a>.</p>
</li>
<li><p>confirm that you have the right to contribute and license the code<br>in question. (Either you hold all rights on the code, or the rights<br>holder has explicitly granted the right to use it like this,<br>through a compatible open source license or through a direct<br>agreement with you.)</p>

<li><p>2 spaces per indentation level, no tabs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Note that the linter (<code>bin/lint</code>) which is run after each commit<br>complains about unused variables and functions. Prefix their names<br>with an underscore to muffle it.</p>
</li>
<li><p>CodeMirror does <em>not</em> follow JSHint or JSLint prescribed style.<br>Patches that try to ‘fix’ code to pass one of these linters will be<br>unceremoniously discarded.</p>
